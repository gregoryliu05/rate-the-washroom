# Rate The Washroom

Welcome to **Rate The Washroom**, an innovative platform that allows users to find clean, review, and rate public washrooms. This repository is a collaborative project for SFU StormHacks 2025 leveraging multiple modern technologies to deliver an intuitive user interface and robust backend.

## Description
Rate the Washroom was built to solve a problem many people quietly struggle with: the fear and anxiety around using public washrooms. Furthermore, to allow disabled and handicapped users to know where accessible washrooms are available. For individuals with bathroom-related anxiety or phobias, uncertainty about cleanliness, privacy, or safety can turn a basic human need into a source of stress and avoidance.

By crowdsourcing real user reviews and cleanliness ratings, Rate the Washroom helps remove that uncertainty. Our goal was simple, make public washrooms more predictable, more accessible, and less intimidating. When people know where clean, reliable washrooms are, they can plan with confidence, reduce anxiety, and reclaim a basic necessity that everyone deserves access to.

## Features
- User-friendly interface to rate washrooms on various parameters.
- Database integration to collect and analyze user feedback.
- Responsive design ensuring accessibility across devices.
- Multi-language support using React (frontend) and Python (backend).
